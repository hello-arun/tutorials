# Energy of isolated atom

While doing adsorbtion calculations we need to calculate energy of a single atom.
For example for Potassium atom adsorbed on pristine graphene the adsorption 
energy is defined as

```math
E_adsob = E_pristine + n*E_K - E_(Pristine+K)
Where
E_K = Energy
```


**We calculate energy of single K atom here**
