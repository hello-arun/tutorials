We calculate here e_ij component of piezoelectric coefficient. e_ij corelates the polarization induced along "i"-direction in reponse strain applied along "j"-directoin.

* e_11 => Polarization along x-axis, Strain along x-axis, 
* e_21 => Polarization along y-axis, Strain along x-axis, 
* e_31 => Polarization along z-axis, Strain along x-axis, 

* e_12 => Polarization along x-axis, Strain along y-axis, 

Berry Phase approach is used to calculate the polarization generally. But For calculating polarization along the non-periodic direction (z-axis) we do not need berry
phase approach as polarization can be uniquely defined by placing the slab in the middle along the z-direction and taking 0,0,0 as the reference. So the case of out
of plane polarization is presented in ex-020-NbN.
