We calculate polarization by both method. The results are as follows

## LCALCPOL method
Results as obtained from `/calc/pol-LCALCPOL/polarization.csv`
```
  volume of cell :      376.22
 Total electronic dipole moment: p[elc]=(     0.00000    -2.01998    -0.00000 ) electrons Angst
            Ionic dipole moment: p[ion]=(     0.00000    17.33540     0.00000 ) electrons Angst
```

## LBERRY method
Results as obtained from `/calc/pol-LBERRY/polarization.csv`

We calculate polarization along *b-axis* here
```
  volume of cell :      376.22
 Total electronic dipole moment: p[elc]=(     0.00000    -2.02083    -0.00000 ) e*Angst
            ionic dipole moment: p[ion]=(     0.00000    17.33540    -0.00000 ) e*Angst
```

We can see value of dipole moment along *b-axis* is same in both cases.
