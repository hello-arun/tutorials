# https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/optimizers.html#optimizers
# We can not use energy based optimizer for NEB calculation so we use optimizer 
# which are solely force based.
#   IBRION = 2 (cg is energy based optimizer)
#   IBRION = 1 (quasi newton), 3(quick min) are force based

# To use optimizer shipped with VTST we need to set
#   IBRION = 3 and POTIM = 0 (This disable the VASP optimizers)
