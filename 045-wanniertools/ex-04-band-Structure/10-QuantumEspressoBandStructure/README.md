In SOC calculations we use Fully Relativistic PseduoPotential.

In calculations that do not include we use Scalar Relativistic Pseudo Potential.

Test2 with SOC included is working fine and is in reasonable agreement with WannierTools Reference.

In Step 2 we will create Tight Binding Model using Wannier90 Package.
