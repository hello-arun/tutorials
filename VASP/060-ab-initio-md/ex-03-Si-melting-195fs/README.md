# ex-02-Si-melting-195fs

This is continuation of the [ex-01-Si-melting](../ex-01-Si-melting/). We copy the CONTCAR file from [ex-01-Si-melting](../ex-01-Si-melting/). Everything else is exactly the same.


## **Questions**

1. How is long-range order reflected in the pair-correlation function?
2. Is the format of the **CONTCAR** and the **POSCAR** file the same? What information does the **CONTCAR** file contain?
3. What do the tags **APACO** and **NPACO** set?
4. Which output file of VASP contains the trajectories of a molecular dynamics simulations?
