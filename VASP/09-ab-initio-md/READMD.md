# Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics

In MD simulations, the motion of atoms (or molecules) at a specific temperature is simulated by means of the classical equation of motion. In other words, each iteration simulates a time step, where atoms are treated as classical particles subject to forces as in Newton's second law. When these forces are computed quantum mechanically using ab-initio methods, one speaks of ab-initio MD. To employ the canonical ensemble, or NVT ensemble, the calculation must be done at constant number of particles (N), constant volume (V) and constant temperature (T).
