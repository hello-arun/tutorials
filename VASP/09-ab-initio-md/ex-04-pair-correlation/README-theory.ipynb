    "The structure of a liquid can be studied using the [radial distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_distribution_function), also known as pair-correlation function. Roughly speaking, it is the probability of finding a particle at a given distance from the center of another particle. More precisely, it is the relative local particle density with respect to the average density of the system at a distance $r$ from the center of an arbitrarily chosen reference particle. Formally, this can be written as\n",

    "where $\\Omega_r$ is the real space volume, $N$ is the number of particles, $\\vec{R}_{ij}= \\vec{R}_i - \\vec{R}_{j}$, and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ takes the ensemble average:\n",

    "Here, $\\mathcal{A}_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observable, macroscopic property, which is written as a time average over $\\mathcal{A}\\left(p(t), q(t)\\right)$ with $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ being the canonical momenta and positions that define the point in [phase space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_space) that changes over time $t$. \n",

    "Recall that, in a crystal, we observe long-range order, which leads to distinct peaks in the [pair-correlation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_distribution_function). In a [liquid state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid), particles are bound firmly, unlike in gases, but not rigidly, in contrast to solids. The characteristic features of the [pair-correlation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_distribution_function) change significantly, when a system melts. \n",
