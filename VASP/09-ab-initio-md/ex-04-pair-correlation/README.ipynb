    "The structure of a liquid can be studied using the [radial distribution function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_distribution_function), also known as pair-correlation function. Roughly speaking, it is the probability of finding a particle at a given distance from the center of another particle. More precisely, it is the relative local particle density with respect to the average density of the system at a distance $r$ from the center of an arbitrarily chosen reference particle. Formally, this can be written as\n",
